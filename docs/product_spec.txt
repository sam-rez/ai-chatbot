Product Name: Acme TaskFlow

Overview
Acme TaskFlow is a web-based task management platform designed for small to mid-sized engineering teams. The product focuses on simplicity, fast onboarding, and real-time collaboration. Users can create projects, add tasks, assign owners, set due dates, and track progress through multiple workflow states.

Core Features
1. Project Management
Users can create multiple projects within an organization. Each project has a name, description, and optional due date. Projects can be archived but not permanently deleted.

2. Task Management
Tasks belong to a single project. Each task has a title, description, status, priority level, assignee, and due date. Supported task statuses include:
- Backlog
- In Progress
- In Review
- Completed
- Blocked

3. User Roles
There are three user roles in the system:
- Admin: Full access to all projects and settings.
- Member: Can create and edit tasks within assigned projects.
- Viewer: Read-only access to projects and tasks.

4. Collaboration
Users can leave comments on tasks. Comments support plain text only and are displayed in chronological order. Users receive notifications when they are mentioned in a comment using the @username syntax.

5. Search
The platform supports keyword search across project names, task titles, and task descriptions. Search results are scoped to projects the user has access to.

Non-Functional Requirements
- The system should support up to 10,000 active users per organization.
- API response times for task-related endpoints should be under 300ms at the 95th percentile.
- The platform should have 99.9% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance.
- All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

Authentication and Authorization
Authentication is handled via email and password with optional two-factor authentication. Authorization is role-based and enforced at both the API and UI levels.

Audit Logging
All changes to tasks and projects must be logged for auditing purposes. Audit logs include the user ID, action performed, timestamp, and affected resource ID.

Out of Scope
- Time tracking
- File attachments
- Native mobile applications
- Public APIs for third-party integrations

Open Questions
- Should completed tasks be auto-archived after a configurable time period?
- Should users be able to customize workflow statuses?
- Is single sign-on (SSO) required for enterprise customers?
